# Sample-Entropy-function-from-wikipedia
I stumbled upon this gem exploring various math topics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_entropy) which really caught my attention. 
I reccomend watching that wiki page as it contains a python implementation example (YAY!) of the code i customized to satiate my intrigue.
This is a function capable of evaluating the amount of "noise/self-similarity" with an array of values increasing 
as what i would dare attempt to further describe as "congruence/disparity", which might also require 
 I do intend to find a way to combine the DFT (already wrote that repo) with an implementation of 
the Bayesian approximation to clarify and/or discover more ways to illustrate the different complex-equation plots (also art for some)

Here is a screenshot of my altered version, which has variables namespace for values that most surerly shouldn't be changed. 
That being said, the Zen of python says that namespaces are aweosome :P
