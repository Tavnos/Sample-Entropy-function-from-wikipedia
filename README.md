# Sample-Entropy-function-from-wikipedia
I stumbled upon this gem exploring various math topics, and this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_entropy) really caught my attention. 
This is a function capable of evaluating the amount of "noise/self-similarity" with an array of values increasing 
as what i would dare attempt to further describe as "congruence/disparity" I reccomend watching that wiki page as it contains a python implementation example (YAY!),
of the code i customized to satiate my intrigue. I do intend to find a way to combine the DFT (already wrote that repo) with an implementation of 
the Bayesian approximation to clarify and/or discover more ways to illustrate the different complex-equation plots (also art for some) 
that i also enjoyed playing with and have documented.
